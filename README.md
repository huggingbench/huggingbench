# ü§ñ Introduction

HuggingBench is an extensible, open-source MLOps tool for experimenting around serving ML models from Huggingface. By running one command from terminal the tool generates various model serving configurations, deploys the model, performs load testing by sending inference requests and shows respective metrics upon completition. This should save time when looking for an optimal model serving cofiguration or just help with understanding latency/throughput and hardware needs for serving the model.

# üìã Requirements

Python 3.9+ is required.

HuggingBench use Docker containers to run various inference servers so you should have Docker available
on your system.

* Instructions for installing Docker on Ubuntu https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/
* Instructions for installing Docker on Mac https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/

## GPU support (optional)

To enable GPU acceleration for Docker containers running on NVidia GPU please follow the instructions
from here https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit#getting-started


# üèÉ Quickstart

Clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/legobench/huggingbench.git```

Build all required Docker images used for converting and optimizing models:

```./docker/build-all.sh```

Create Python environment and activate:

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies and the project:

```pip install -e .```

Pull Nvidia Triton server docker image (approx 8GB in size):

```docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:23.06-py3```

Run command to see how client concurreny affects serving of HuggingFace model https://huggingface.co/prajjwal1/bert-tiny using NVidia Triton Inference server:

```hbench triton --hf_id prajjwal1/bert-tiny --client_workers 1 2 4```

Above will generate 3 experiments: first with 1 concurrent client, then 2 and 4. Each experiment will spin
up a docker container with Triton server, deploy the model with the right configuration and generate the load
by sending inference requests. Upon completion metric table will be presented in the terminal along with the 
charts exported in JPEG. 

# üí° How it works

![HuggingBench Architecture](./docs/huggingbench-arch.png?raw=true "HuggingBench Architecture")

HuggingBench can be extended with an additional inference servers by implementing the Plugin. At the
moment NVidia Triton server is only supported but more are coming soon. We also encourage you to contribute
and help us make HugggingBench better!


Docker containers are used a lot to helps us avoid dependency hell: no need to manually
install the right depenendencies thus reducing the friction. Two main use cases covered by
Docker containers: (1) converting and optimizing the model (2) inference server for model serving.
Note that the actual model and it's configuration is stored on host disk under configured `workspace` 
folder and shared(bind) with respective Docker containers. 

## üß© Experiments

Here is a list of flags that can be passed in as command line arguments that are used to generate experiments
we want to benchmark:


| Flag | Description | Options | Default |
| ---- | ---         | ---     | ---     |
| `format` | Model format to use. | onnx, trt, openvino | onnx |
| `device` | Device model runs on. | cpu, gpu | cpu |
| `precision` | Model precision. | fp32, fp16 | fp32 |
| `client_workers` | Number of concurrent clients sending inference requests | integer | 1 |
| `hf_id` | Hugging Face model ID. It needs to be public because we download the model from HuggingFace | eg. bert-base-uncased | |
| `batch_size` | Batch size for sending inference requests. Many model have max batch size of 4 | usually from 1 to 4  | 1 |
| `instance_count` | How many instances of ML model to create. More instances can help with throughput but require more HW resource | 1 or few | 1 |

Experiments are cartesian product of all given CLI arguments. For example if we provide `--format onnx openvino` and `--client_workers 1 2 4` we will generate 6 experiments: [[onnx, 1], [onnx,2], [onnx,4], [openvino, 1], [openvino, 2], [openvino, 4]].


## üìä Results


Here is an example of the output generated by running `hbench triton --hf_id prajjwal1/bert-tiny --client_workers 1 2 4`:

Inference throughput (req/s):
 
![Inference throughput (req/s)](./docs/throughputs.png?raw=true "Inference throughput (req/s)")

Above chart is showing that by increasing concurrency on the client side we increase model serving throughput.

Inference latency p90:

![Inference latency](./docs/90_percentile_latencies.png "Inference latency")

Above chart is showing that increased client concurrency leads to increased latency which is expected
as more requests are served at the same time.

## Prometheus metrics

To provide better insight into benchmarks we collect metrics with Prometheus and use Grafana for charting.
We collect metrics from respective inference server (eg Triton) together with the metrics emitted by HuggingBench. Follow the instructions [here](./docker/observability/README.md) to setup benchmark `Observability` stack.
Grafana should be preloaded with pre-defined benchmark Dashboard.

Charts showing few metrics while benchmarking `bert-base-uncased` deployed on Triton and Mac M1:
